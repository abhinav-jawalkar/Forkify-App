Forkify is a web application where one can search for a host of recipes. It comes with exciting functionalities and a beautifully designed UI. Forkify makes use of an API developed by the creator, Jonas Schmedtmann, on Heroku, as the original API had been closed. What's iinteresting is that the quantities of the items in a recipe can be altered to alter the number of servings, and these items can also be added to a shopping list so that the whole process is hassle free. Created and mentored by Jonas Schmedtmann from 'The Complete Javascript Course' on Udemy.
